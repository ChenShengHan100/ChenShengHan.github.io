### **Research Assistant**
**2024â€“Present | SDU Time Lab**

Engaged in research on long-tailed visual recognition under the guidance of Prof. Xiankai Lu and Prof. Yilong Yin.

#### Key Contributions:
-   Developed a novel data augmentation framework where a multi-agent system perceives the classifier's state to dynamically select optimal augmentation policies for long-tailed recognition (AAAI 2026 under Review).
-   Tackled the long-tailed recognition problem from an optimization perspective by designing a specialized optimizer for imbalanced data (CVPR 2026 in Preparation).
