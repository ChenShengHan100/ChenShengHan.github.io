My current research on Long-Tailed Visual Recognition has led to the following projects:

- AAAI 2026 Submission: Developed a novel data augmentation framework using a multi-agent system that perceives the classifier's state to select optimal policies. (Status: Submitted and currently under review).

- CVPR 2026 Preparation: Designing a specialized optimizer from an optimization perspective to effectively handle imbalanced data. (Status: Manuscript in preparation).
